# The Index of Babel — pending task list

What is still to do, and nothing else. Remove a task as it is completed — the
code and the git log are the record of what was.

## A11y:
- No actual screen reader testing has happened yet. Learn orca and test
  manually. See accessibility-plan.md for more details on what to check, and
  other lingering questions.
- The ranked results listbox (accessibility-plan.md §3.2) now lives in the
  dev panel, which is `?debug`-only. Give it a non-debug home before this
  matters for anyone relying on the lossless reading of a search.

## Hosting:
- The Cloudflare abuse protection in `infra/abuse-protection.tf` only scopes
  `assets_hostname` (the R2 bucket). `/api/search` is a much better DoS target
  than static asset serving - it's CPU-bound ML inference on an unprotected
  origin. Add a second ruleset (rate limit + short-TTL cache keyed on the
  query string) scoped to the app's hostname for that endpoint specifically.

- **`server-nginx.conf` does not exist in this repo** (noticed 9/14/26 while
  wiring up `deploy/`). `AGENTS.md`'s "Deployment and the base path" section
  and `packages/server/index.ts`'s header both name it as the file that makes
  a subpath deployment work, quoting two specific `location` blocks from it,
  but there is no such file tracked here and it is not in `.gitignore` — it
  only ever lived on the VPS. Either commit the real thing (it is the one
  piece of the deployment still managed entirely by hand, and the one the
  workflow's public health check fails on when it is wrong) or stop pointing
  at it by name from two files. Do not reconstruct it from the AGENTS.md
  description without diffing against the live file first.
- **The CLIP weights cache inside `node_modules`.** transformers.js defaults
  `env.cacheDir` to `node_modules/@huggingface/transformers/.cache`, so any
  `npm ci` throws away a few hundred MB of downloaded model.
  `deploy/deploy.sh` moves it aside and back across the install, which works
  but means a deploy script knows where a dependency keeps its cache. Setting
  `env.cacheDir` to a path outside the tree where `app.ts` imports the model
  would delete that coupling, and would also let the Docker image mount the
  cache as a volume instead of re-downloading on every container start.

## CI:
- **Nothing builds the `Dockerfile`.** It exists so hosting can move without a
  rewrite, and it will drift out of step with `package.json` unnoticed until
  the day that matters. A build-only job is enough — no push, no registry.

## The public face:
- **Nothing tells a visitor what the site stores.** Favoriting mints a token in
  `localStorage` and sends it to the server, and the whole shape of
  `favorites.ts` is an argument about refusing to spy on people — an argument
  no reader can currently see. A short paragraph in `HelpDialog` would say it.
- **`README.md` describes a center tile that no longer exists** — "5 shelves ×
  32 books = 160 books", abandoned in concept.md's 8/18/26 entry — and its
  "What it is" section is still a TODO while the site is live at the URL
  printed above it.

## Corpus loading:
- **A corpus that half-loads says nothing.** All three fetches in
  `useCorpus.ts` end in `.catch(() => {})`, so a missing `metadata.json` or
  `embeddings.bin` — a plausible result of an interrupted `tools/upload` sync —
  renders a library that searches and ranks with quietly degraded results. The
  manifest fetch has an error state; these deserve one too, or at least a line
  in the HUD.

## Favorites:
- `favorites.e2e.ts` covers the map badge and the in-place resort that follows
  a toggle while sorted by favorites. The catalog side is still uncovered: a
  spec favoriting a room from a catalog ROW, switching the sort and reloading
  would close the remaining half of the path.
- The JSON store is one file written by one process. If a second process ever
  serves this corpus, that is the moment for the Postgres adapter behind
  `FavoriteStore` rather than a lock on the file.

## Search:
- **The int8 quantisation scale is stated twice, once on each side of
  `embeddings.bin`** — `QUANT_SCALE` in `tools/embed/embed.ts` writes it,
  `EMBEDDING_SCALE` in `packages/map/ordering.ts` reads it, both 127, with no
  import binding them. Ranking is immune to a drift between them (a monotone
  factor cannot reorder), so the symptom would be `matchCertainty` reading the
  wrong absolute cosine and the density gradient clustering at the wrong
  confidence. `embeddings.json` already records `scale` and nothing reads it
  back — carrying it through the manifest removes the constant from the client
  entirely.

## Rendering:
- **WebGL is the default renderer** (`webglFlag.ts`'s `DEFAULT_WEBGL`), with
  `?webgl=0` as the Canvas2D escape hatch and a `supportsWebGL2()` probe that
  falls back automatically. Canvas2D is still a full second renderer, kept in
  lockstep (see AGENTS.md's "The WebGL renderer") and covered by
  `render-parity.parity.ts`. Open question, no work scheduled: whether to
  eventually retire Canvas2D. Retiring it drops the parity suite, the
  `?webgl=0` hatch, and the whole `render.ts`/`slide.ts` path - worth doing
  only once WebGL has real production mileage and nothing has needed the hatch.

## Rearrangement / camera:
- **[2026-09-10] A `flyTo` issued while a rearrangement is animating has no
  effect, and a search can sometimes trigger what looks like a SECOND full
  rearrangement cycle with no further user action.** Found while chasing
  flakiness in `map-gestures.e2e.ts`'s `right-clicking a room opens its
  card`/`a long press opens the card` tests (both click the 'center' button,
  then `landed()`, then act on a fixed screen point - see AGENTS.md's
  Testing-and-CI note on `recentre()`, added as the practical fix for the
  test suite).

  Confirmed by direct instrumentation (a page-injected HUD-transition
  recorder plus a `page.on('request')` listener during a run of `a search
  reorders the library around wherever the camera already is` followed by
  `right-clicking a room…`):
  - Exactly ONE `/api/search` request fires for the one Enter press (ruled
    out a duplicate submit).
  - `useSearch.ts`'s `search()` only calls `requestAnimationRef.current(...)`
    once per resolved fetch for a non-empty term (read the source; only one
    branch executes).
  - Despite that, the HUD shows a full `rearranging · preparing…` → `100%`
    cycle landing back at the search field's camera position, and then -
    with ZERO clicks or other interaction - a SECOND full `preparing…` →
    `100%` cycle starts within ~150ms and runs for ~1.5-3s more.
  - A plain `button[hasText=center].click()` issued during (or just before)
    that second cycle has NO effect on the final camera position - it lands
    exactly where the rearrangement itself was already headed, not at the
    clicked target. `landed()` still reports "settled" because it only
    checks for two consecutive stable reads, which a still-controlled camera
    also produces.

  **[2026-09-12] A cloud agent container reproduces this DETERMINISTICALLY,
  which is the instrumented repro this entry asks for below.** Both tests fail
  on every run there, not intermittently, and both fail the same way:
  `locator('.overlay')` times out after 5s because the room card never opens -
  the click lands at a fixed screen point that no longer holds a room, exactly
  what a swallowed `flyTo` would cause. The other 13 tests in the file pass, as
  do `catalog`, `accessibility`, `favorites`, `shelf`, `artist-statement`,
  `keyboard-cursor` and `webgl-map` in full.

  ```sh
  BABEL_E2E_CHROMIUM=/opt/pw-browsers/chromium node --import \
    ./build/register.mjs --test --test-concurrency=1 \
    packages/web/e2e/map-gestures.e2e.ts
  ```

  What that pins down:
  - It is NOT a regression from any recent branch. Reproduced identically at
    `4df7e20` (merge of #159), `85d7555` (merge of #160 `overlay-header-chrome`,
    whose name made it the obvious suspect - it is not) and `f8493a7`.
  - It is NOT environmental in the "different browser build" sense: the whole
    suite including these two is GREEN in GitHub Actions on `f8493a7`
    (`browser smoke test`, run 34705031196). A slower machine turning a latent
    race into a 100% failure is the simplest story that fits both readings.
  - `recentre()` is already in place in the right-click test and is still not
    enough here, so whatever it works around is not fully worked around.
  - The long-press test is a CASCADE, not a second instance: it never
    recentres, it inherits the camera the right-click test left behind. Fixing
    the first should fix the second, and a fix must be judged on both.

  So the cheap path for whoever picks this up is a container rather than a
  bisect: the failure is already sitting there every run, with no flake-hunting
  needed.

  **[2026-09-14] It is no longer deterministic there.** Across five runs of the
  file in one cloud container, both tests passed together once and failed
  together four times - so a green run proves nothing and the repro still needs
  a repeat count. The runs were split either side of an unrelated fix to the
  page's own overflow (`#root { overflow: clip }`, which the pass and two of
  the failures share), so the difference is not that fix.

  Not yet root-caused. Candidates not yet ruled out: something downstream of
  `setResult` (e.g. `sortResult`/`layout`'s `useMemo` in `main.tsx`, or
  `pushHistory`) causing `useRearrangement.ts`'s effect to see `layout`/
  `order` change twice for one `requestAnimation()` call; a legitimate
  second animated pass that isn't a bug at all (e.g. a graded/clustered
  density recompute) but should then update the "rearranging" HUD text or
  `AGENTS.md`'s invariants to say so explicitly; or `startRearrangement`
  itself re-triggering under some condition on a small/cold-cache corpus.
  Worth an instrumented repro (the recorder script used above, not
  committed) as the starting point rather than re-discovering this from
  scratch.

  Separately, whether this is a bug or not, `useMapCamera.ts`'s `flyTo`
  currently has no way to interrupt an active rearrangement - AGENTS.md's
  "Camera and gestures" section documents `pointerdown`/`wheel` each
  dropping an in-flight flight, and the rearrangement section documents
  "Anything that moves the camera mid-rearrangement (pan, zoom, `flyTo`)
  must end the animation instead" - but a `flyTo` from a control (not a
  gesture) does not currently do this. Confirm whether that's the intended
  reading of the invariant and, if so, wire `flyTo` to end an active
  rearrangement the same way a pointer grab does.
